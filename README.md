# Tech Radar

Based on the [Zalando Tech-Radar](https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar).

Available at <http://maroda.github.io/radar>.

This is my personal radar, which I have used as a framework for developing them elsewhere.

Since this is being hosted by Github Pages, it uses the optional `/docs/` directory to store the content.

The root directory (with this README) can use `yarn` for local development:

1. `brew install node yarn`
2. `yarn`
3. `yarn start`

The Tech Radar will be available at <http://localhost:3000>.
